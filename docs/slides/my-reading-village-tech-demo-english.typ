== Flutter: one codebase, any device

#columns-content()[
  Flutter is Google's open-source UI toolkit. Write code *once* in Dart, compile to native for Android, iOS, Web, and Desktop.

  #v(10pt)
  *How is that possible?*

  Flutter ships its own *rendering engine*. It does not rely on each platform's native UI components, it draws every pixel itself, directly to the GPU canvas.

  #v(8pt)
  #cbox(fill: pink)[
    #set text(size: 13pt)
    *No browser. No bridge layer.*
    Flutter compiles to native ARM machine code. Performance is comparable to apps written natively in Swift (iOS) or Kotlin (Android).

== Clean Architecture in Flutter

#columns-content()[
  #set text(size: 12pt)
  The codebase is split into *four layers*. Each layer has one responsibility. The key rule: *dependencies only point inward*, outer layers know about inner ones, never the reverse.

  #v(6pt)
  #cbox(fill: mint)[
    #set text(size: 11pt)
    *Why this matters:* the database can be swapped for cloud storage, or the state library replaced, without touching any business logic. The innermost layer has zero framework imports.
  ]

  #v(6pt)
  #set text(size: 11pt)
  This is the same "ports and adapters" pattern used in well-structured backend services, the same principles apply equally well on mobile.
