### Code Conventions

This project follows these conventions — please respect them in any contribution:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Rule</th>
      <th>Details</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Language</strong></td>
      <td>All code, variable names, comments, and commit messages must be in <strong>English</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Dart</strong></td>
      <td>Follow standard Dart conventions and linting rules. Run <code>flutter analyze</code> before submitting</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Game rendering</strong></td>
      <td>All game rendering must use the <strong>Flame Engine</strong> — do not use plain Flutter widgets for in-game elements</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>No server-side storage</strong></td>
      <td>All user data must remain on-device in the local SQLite database — no external API calls for data storage</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>State management</strong></td>
      <td>Use existing Provider classes (<code>VillageProvider</code>, <code>BookProvider</code>) — create new providers only if necessary</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Game constants</strong></td>
      <td>All balance values (costs, timers, XP) must be defined in <code>lib/config/game_constants.dart</code> — no magic numbers in game logic</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Database changes</strong></td>
      <td>Schema changes require a migration in <code>lib/data/database_helper.dart</code> to avoid breaking existing users</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Assets</strong></td>
      <td>All sprites and images go in <code>assets/images/</code> and must follow the existing kawaii pastel art style</td>
    </tr>
